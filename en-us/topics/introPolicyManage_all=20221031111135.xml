  <p><indexterm>policy management</indexterm>Unlike the
   <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>configurations<?oxy_custom_end?>
   available on the <uicontrol>Agents</uicontrol> screen (which are one-time commands for triggering
   immediate actions), the policy management on the <uicontrol>Policy</uicontrol> page are for
   pattern deployment to the agents.</p>
  <p>After users organize agents into various groups and build up multi-level hierarchy among the
   groups (parent groups above child groups), two types of policy management are available for
    choice:<ul id="ul_jpf_rpw_m5b">
    <li>
     <p>Policy <uicontrol>Inherited</uicontrol>: The group policy is inherited from the parent
      group</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Policy <uicontrol>Customized</uicontrol>: The group policy is customized for specific
      agents/groups by the StellarOne administrators</p>
    </li>
   </ul><note id="note_krh_vpb_jvb">
    <p><uicontrol>Self-managed</uicontrol>: This special policy setting allows local agents to be
     free from StellarOne's policy management and instead, to be managed directly by the on-site
     operators. Though it's a policy setting, the <uicontrol>Self-managed</uicontrol> status will be
     shown under the <uicontrol>Policy Inheritance</uicontrol> column heading on the
      <uicontrol>Agents</uicontrol> screen.</p>
