                                    component update schedule for the agents (StellarProtect). The
                                    system can run component update automatically at users' assigned
                                    time frequency.</p>

                                <p>This newly-added group policy allows the operators on site to
                                    configure the agents' policy settings on their own. Once being
                                    switched to the self-management status, the local agents are
                                    free from the StellarOne console's policy management.</p>
