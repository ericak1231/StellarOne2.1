                <li>
                    <p>StellarOne, the centralized management console designed to streamline
                        administration of both StellarProtect for modernized systems and
                        StellarProtect (Legacy Model) for legacy systems.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>StellarProtect, the unified agent with industrial-grade next-generation
                        antivirus and application lockdown endpoint security deployment for
                        modernized OT/ICS endpoints.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>StellarProtect (Legacy Model), for trust-list based application lockdown of
                        legacy and fixed-use OT/ICS endpoints with on-demand AV scan.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Together, TXOne Stellar allows protection for modernized and legacy systems running
            side-by-side to be coordinated and maintained from the same management console, helping
            protect businesses against security threats and increase productivity.</p>
