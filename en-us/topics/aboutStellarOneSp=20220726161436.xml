    <conbody>
        <p>TXOne Stellar Series is a first-of-its-kind OT endpoint protection platform, which
            includes:</p>
        <p>
            <ul id="ul_bbg_sg1_35b">
                <li>
                    <p>TXOne StellarOne, the centralized management console designed to streamline
                        administration of both StellarProtect for modernized systems and
                        StellarProtect (Legacy Model) for legacy systems.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>StellarProtect, the unified agent with industrial-grade next-generation
                        antivirus and application lockdown endpoint security deployment for
                        modernized ICS endpoints.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>StellarProtect (Legacy Model), for trust-list-based application lockdown of
                        legacy and fixed-use ICS endpoints with on-demand AV scan.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Together, the Stellar Series allows protection for modernized and legacy systems running
            side-by-side to be coordinated and maintained from the same management console, helping
            protect businesses against security threats and increase productivity.</p>
