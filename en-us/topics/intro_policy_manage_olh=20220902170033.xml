 <conbody>
  <p>Unlike the settings offered on the <wintitle>Agents</wintitle> screen (which are one-time
   commands for triggering immediate actions), users configure the <wintitle>Policy</wintitle>
   settings for long-term pattern deployment on the agents.</p>
  <p>After users organize agents into various groups and build up multi-level hierarchy among the
   groups (parent groups above child groups), they can configure the <wintitle>Policy</wintitle>
   settings for the top-level groups and apply the policy settings to each level by:<ul
    id="ul_jpf_rpw_m5b">
    <li>
     <p>Policy <uicontrol>Inherited</uicontrol>: The group policy is inherited from the parent
      group</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Policy <uicontrol>Customized</uicontrol>: The group policy is customized for specific
      agents/groups via StellarOne console</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Policy <uicontrol>Self-managed</uicontrol>: The group policy is self-managed by local
      agents/groups. The local agents/groups are free from the StellarOne console's policy
      management and the operators at local side can configure policy settings on their own.</p>
    </li>
   </ul></p>
