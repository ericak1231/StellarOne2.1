 <conbody>
  <p>The <uicontrol>Predictive Machine Learning</uicontrol> uses intelligent machine learning
   technology to correlate threat information and perform an in-depth file analysis for emerging
   unknown security risk detection through digital DNA fingerprinting, API mapping, and other file
   properties. <uicontrol>Predictive Machine Learning</uicontrol> also performs a behavioral
   analysis on unknown or low-prevalence processes to determine if an emerging or unknown threat is
   attempting to infect your network. <uicontrol>Predictive Machine Learning</uicontrol> is a
   powerful tool that helps protect your assets and network environment against unidentified threats
   and zero-day attacks.</p>
  <p>Turn on the <uicontrol>Predictive Machine Learning</uicontrol> function by simply checking it
   after you enable the <uicontrol>Real-Time Malware Scan</uicontrol>.</p>
