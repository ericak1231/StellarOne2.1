            <p><uicontrol>Real-time Malware Scan</uicontrol> provides persistent and ongoing file
                scan for the endpoints. Each time a file is received, opened, downloaded, copied, or
                modified, <uicontrol>Real-time Malware Scan</uicontrol> always scans the file for
                security assessment. After performing the <uicontrol>Real-time Malware
                    Scan</uicontrol>, users can proceed to access the file if it does not pose a
                security threat. However, if a security risk or possible virus/malware has been
                detected during the scanning, a notification message appears indicating the name of
                the infected file and the specific security risk.</p>
            <p>Moreover, a persistent scan cache is maintained and reloaded each time the
                    <uicontrol>Real-time Malware Scan</uicontrol> is executed. The
                    <uicontrol>Real-time Malware Scan</uicontrol> tracks any changes made to files
                or folders that have occurred until the function is disabled and the files are
                unloaded and removed from the scan cache.</p>
